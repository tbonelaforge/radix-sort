# radix-sort

Using radix sort to sort an array of integers.
Inspired by a codility exercise to count all "triangular triples" in a given array of integers,
where each integer is positive.

this radix sort uses two queues (The zero-queue and the one-queue), to bin the given integers based
on increasingly significant binary digits.
